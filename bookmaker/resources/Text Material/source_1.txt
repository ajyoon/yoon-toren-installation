i am a bird. i choose everything i do. my soul is as radiant as the sun. it shines through the back of my heart and i can see right through my body. i will become translucent and burst into tiny shimmers. i’m still sitting here. everything is massive. my lungs take in the slowest, deepest breath and blow open releasing a million teardrops. my belly is glowing bright. my eyes are omnipresent and my throat is a canyon. i rush past zion, past reality, i’m leaving you. for now, i am a bird. i am planting stars, watching seas and caressing the moon. would you speak?
