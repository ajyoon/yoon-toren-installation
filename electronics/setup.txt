Setup instructions
==================

1) Install the latest version of Python 3.

2) Install project requirements using pip from your computer's terminal:
-------------------------------
cd /path/to/drone/folder
pip install -r requirements.txt
-------------------------------
This may take some time.

3) To launch the program, simply run main.py with python in your terminal:
------------------------
cd /path/to/drone/folder
python main.py
------------------------
Make sure that the input and output devices are connected
before launching the program.

The program uses input from your computer's primary audio input channel.
This should lead to a simple microphone which captures the sound on stage.
The exact position and quality of the microphone is not crucial, as
it is only used to measure the amplitude of the on-stage sound.
